# Week 3 Report

## This week's progress
Started working on the local solving part of the AI and finished it.
Next would be the clearly harder global solving.
I made a separate class for common methods used in the AI to keep the main AI class cleaner.
The AI can now finish games that don't have complex situations,
the AI does one turn of solving by clicking the middle mouse button.
I also wrote javadoc for the new class' methods.

Made some improvements to the requirements specification doc as well as fixed some minor things.

The plan is to do tests for the existing classes next.
