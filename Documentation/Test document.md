# Performance
The AI is very fast. It is much faster than what is necessary for it's use case.
It will solve the game as far as possible without guessing in the blink of an eye.

## Manual testing
Manual testing was performed for the game as if a real user was using the software.
I made a script with AutoHotkey that clicks the middle mouse button (AI button)
500 times / second. Next step is to reveal tiles randomly until the AI gains a foothold.

The results from this manual testing can be seen here:\

This is not the maximum speed of solving though. The application just starts to lag with
quicker inputs. If these solving steps were to be repeated within the application itself,
the solver would most likely be near instantaneous.
