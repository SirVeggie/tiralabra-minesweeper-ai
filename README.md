# Minesweeper Solver

An AI that looks at a minesweeper game and tells you which squares to click.

Code under 'game' is the actual game, while code under 'solver' is the AI.
So the 'game' is not part of the project since the project is the solver AI.

Code under 'game' is copied and modified from here:
